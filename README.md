My dad and I with our latest project completed, a custom 1978 Marshall JMP 2204 Plexi tube amplifier with a reactive load box. Since buying a JMP Marshall Plexi from the 70's on the used market costs thousands of dollars, we decided to add our own touch to a classic and make one. 

Known for its powerful, dynamic, and crunchy rock tone, famously used by guitarists like Jimi Hendrix, Angus Young, Pete Townshend, and Eric Clapton, it came out to be such a fun amp to play around with.

# Parts List
Originally, I was going to buy all of the parts seperate to build the amplifier. But, it was less expensive to buy the 50W british amp kit kit from [Mojotone](https://mojotone.com/products/british-style-50w-guitar-tube-amp-kit?variant=41672737521760) so I ended up going that route. The instructions and schematics were very clear and labeled, which helped a lot in the build process.

# Schematics
With this kit, you can build either the 1976 Plexi or 1978 Plexi with cascaded gain stages. I ended up going with the 1978 model to be able to get more gain from the amplifier. Curretly no mods are installed, but I will update this repo with their respective schematics.

The schematic and wiring diagram is shown below:

# Build Process
## Amplifier
The build was very straightforward and there was not any issues that arose. The finished chassis is shown below:

## Enclosure
For the enclosure, we modeled it after the Plexi amp head size. For the construction, we made sure to add bracing inside the enclosure for structural rigidity for the 30+ pound amplifier. 

For a unique finish that Marshall does not provide, we decided to use plywood and use two different colors of stain to add a nice two tone color. We chose a darker walnut stain for the outside, and a red toned stain for contrast. The effect was a really deep and unique look that looks amazing!

After staining, coats of polyurathane were applied and polished with an electric buffer and car polish for a glassy and reflective shine. 

# Conclusion
Can’t wait to see what different modifications I can add to the circuit for even more versatility!
